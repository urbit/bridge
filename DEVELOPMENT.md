# Development notes

## Install / Build

Clone the repo, and use a simple `npm install`. You can then use a `npm run build` to create an optimised static build (serve it with e.g. [serve](http://npmjs.com/package/serve), or with python as described above).

## General notes

For development, use `npm run pilot` to get going after a `npm install`. This
will boot up a [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) node in the background, deploy the Azimuth contracts to
it, and fire up a local webserver. Bridge will be served on `localhost:3000`.

Note that one of our dependencies itself depends on a library called
`handle-thing` which breaks under the Ledger support requirements (see below)
on node 11.1.0, so make sure you're using some other node version.

You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), for example, and do:

```
$ nvm install 14.17.0
$ nvm use v14.17.0
```

before running `npm run pilot`.

## Useful accounts

The ecliptic owner is the only account that's able to create galaxies, so
it's a good place to get started. On the testnet, it's the address:

```
0x6DEfFb0caFDB11D175F123F6891AA64F01c24F7d
```

You can authenticate as it using the following mnemonic:

```
benefit crew supreme gesture quantum web media hazard theory mercy wing kitten
```

Under that mnemonic, Ganache will also auto-populate the following accounts
with 100 ETH:

```
0x6deffb0cafdb11d175f123f6891aa64f01c24f7d
0xd53208cf45fc9bd7938b200bff8814a26146688f
0x7b2a2d51e4d8fac602e20a5f6907ff9fbd88e1fd
0xf48062ae8bafd6ef19cd6cb89db93a0d0ca6ce26
0xf84a77aeb351c49dfa87e805a659d2daddff7606
0x167e357cf8b845370d0d408f9b389b66185b7b5b
0xcbecf3abc9878f07afc851aead2d8f1c436cc71d
0x0afc0c3f4eeea500871f464ca71eef5e54a9af36
0x6d654ef2489674d21aed428e8a4ad8ca4820f125
0x218f6f87683db546ad47a5dc8b480e5a9b694866
```

To play around with any of these, authenticate using the same mnemonic, but
use a custom HD path of `m/44'/60'/0'/0/1`, `m/44'/60'/0'/0/2`, and so on.

## Initial development state

You can also tweak a couple of things to change your development state
somewhat (say, for example, you want to start on the points list screen, instead
of having to re-authenticate whenever you make a change or refresh the page):

- The `.env.development` file contains environment variables that you can
  provide to the application when it's running in development. You can access
  them via `process.env.REACT_APP_<whatever>`.

- Set `REACT_APP_STUB_LOCAL='true'` in `.env.development` to enabled stubbing of
  certain methods throughout the app.

- The top of the Bridge component in `src/Bridge.js` can be tweaked for setting
  your initial state. You can provide a specific wallet,
  network type, and so on.

- `npm run pilot` will check the `WITH_TEST_STATE` environment variable to setup
  the initial chain state. Possible values are `STAR_RELEASE` or `INVITES`.
  The state setup can be found in `migrations/1_migration.js`

## HTTPS

For development, you can enable HTTPS on localhost without a certificate for
Chrome by pasting the following into the URL bar:

```
chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost
```

In Firefox, you may need to allow connecting to the unsecured local node
websocket. Do this by going to `about:config` and setting the
`network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS` flag to `true`.

Additionally you need to run with the `HTTPS` environment variable set to
`true`. Note that `npm run pilot` will handle this automatically.

## Testing

Automated tests for critical user journeys are coming Soon™️. Until then, here are several manual test cases to consider when making changes. It's worth noting that what to test depends on what the changes are. These test cases have limited utility when you are making a small change on a single screen; however, they are certainly a good idea when touching critical pieces such as transaction sending or secrets derivation.

### Mnemonic Login

"As a user, I can log into Bridge using a BIP39 mnemonic phrase"

1. Click the 'Mnemonic, Metamask, Hardware Wallet ...' Button, then click 'Mnemonic (BIP 39)'
2. Paste the mnemonic above (in 'Useful Accounts') into the text area, then click 'Login'
3. Confirm that you are able to view the Points list view. Since no points have been created yet, you should see the following message:
> No points to display. This wallet is not the owner or proxy for any points.

### Planet Creation

"As a user, I can create a new planet"

1. Once a star has been created, click it in the points list
2. Click "Issue Point", enter one of the suggested planet names, and sign and send the transaction
3. Log out and back into Bridge, confirm that the newly created planet is rendered in the points list

### Invite Issuance

"As a user, I can create a new invite"

First, in `Bridge.js`, set the `INITIAL_NETWORK_TYPE` to Ropsten:
```js
const INITIAL_NETWORK_TYPE = NETWORK_TYPES.ROPSTEN;
```

Then, in `tank.js`, set the port to `3011`:
```js
const baseUrl = 'https://gas-tank.urbit.org:3011';
```

1. Ask one of the Collaborators of this project for an Invite code :)

(If you're generating a code, don't forget to set `inviteMail.js` port to `:3012` for testnet)

### Invite Acceptance

"As a new Urbit user, I can set up a new ID with an activation code"

1. On the Bridge landing page, click the small "Activate" link
2. Paste the Invite code from the previous test case, and click "Go"
3. Download the Passport file, then use the enclosed Master Ticket and ID to login to Bridge again
### Known Issues

When testing the invite acceptance and login flow on Ropsten, some of the Azimuth API calls will fail (e.g., `getConditional`). 

## Releases

To generate a release `bridge-$VERSION.zip` file, use a simple `npm run release`.

This will pack the build directory together with the README, `bridge-https.py`
script, and also generate a set of checksums for the build directory. You can
verify the checksums on e.g. MacOS via `shasum -c checksums.txt`.

## L2 Local Environment

To work with the L2 aggregator locally, set up the local environment like so:

```sh
# Start ganache and apply the yu/naive-fallback branch from urbit/azimuth
ganache-cli --host '0.0.0.0' -m 'benefit crew supreme gesture quantum web media hazard theory mercy wing kitten'
truffle migrate with-state --reset --compile-all

# Build urbit at naive/fake-txs branch, start a local fake ship, then run these in the dojo:
:azimuth|watch 'http://0.0.0.0:8545'
|start %aggregator
|start %aggregator-rpc

# If having CORS issues with API requests, try this:
> |cors-approve ~~https~3a.~2f.~2f.localhost~3a.3000
```
